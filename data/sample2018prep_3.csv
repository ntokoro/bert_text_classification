11,Cure to Cancer Meaning Hey guys There's this question that I've always wanted an answer to yet never really asked When people say a cure to cancer often is this even possible (in technical aspects I'll explain) I know cancer could affect all kinds of areas from the brain lung neck head etc So does the statement a cure to cancer make sense or can a cure only be found for one area and then another cure must be found for another area In other words if you could also explain are the mechanisms of what proliferates cancer common to all body parts making a cure for one part essentially a cure for another or does cancer work significantly different for different body parts Thanks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

24,I'm so lost and frustrated about my dad's cancer My father is in week 5 of throats cancer treatment and it seems like only the last few days he has dramatically gone downhill in terms of his condition The thing is his cancer is quickly being destroyed and the doctors have been encouraged about his progress The radiation and chemo have taken a heavy toll He refuses to eat and today he doesn't want to get up He just lays there staring off or sleeping The thick mucous builds and he has to get up constantly to throw up which agitates him even more Where I am pissed is that during his radiation today he told the doctor he wanted to be admitted but they told him they cannot because they cannot find anything to admit him for His vitals were good and they believe he is his own worst enemy now I feel like when I wake up in the morning he won't be alive as he is just completely sapped of energy and any will to move forward My mom is very upset and feels even more helpless than I do I wish there was something I could,2,2,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0

418,First PET scan since remission unexpected results I had my first PET scan since finishing chemo in October of 2017 My PET scan in November came up clean complete remission for Hodgkin's Lymphoma The results were not what I expected They found some new activity in my lungs My oncologist doesn't think it's lymphoma or anything cancerous at this time but she does want me to get a lung biopsy next week The activity was hot on the scan so it's definitely something that needs further inspection It's just a total bummer that we don't know what it is There was similar activity in August The radiologist found what appeared to be a pneumonia in my lungs though I was never diagnosed with it The scan in November seemed to suggest that whatever blip had appeared in my lungs was growing smaller The diagnosis was that it was an inflammatory process that would work itself out and disappear on it's own At the end of December I got a bad head cold and a really weird rash all over my body It was strange to me because I have never broken out like that in my 30 years of existence,1,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,1

463,Temodar or PCV and Brain tumor advice Hello I am a 20 year old dude diagnosed with a grade III brain tumor last August (Anaplastic oligodendroglioma) A little over two weeks ago I underwent a successful awake craniotomy that removed about 70 percent of the tumor! Big shoutout to Penn for the amazing treatment I've recieved Dr Brem is a hero In the coming weeks I'll start radiation and chemotherapy to get the rest of that sly cunt My oncologist gave two possible chemo regimens Either six to nine months temodar or PCV She recomended PCV but from my understanding different cancer centers recommend temodar Temodar seems easier and is shorter so I'm leaning towards that Honestly I don't know what to expect from either of these I'm hoping survivors out there can share their experiences with either of these and chemo in general From my discussions with the oncologist PCV is recommended over temodar because PCV has been around longer and there's more studies that show it successfully treats oligodendrogliomas However temodar seems solid enough and if there are significantly less side effects while still treating the tumor it seems like the clear choice I'm hoping to get back,1,2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,1

686,Seriously considering quitting treatment 28F stage 3C uterine sarcoma I had a total hysterectomy in october then IVF egg retrieval and started chemo in December The thing is the chemo and radiation were considered adjuvant treatment to prevent recurrence My cancer Does have an almost 80% recurrence rate without adjuvant treatment and prognosis after recurrence is piss poor But aside from recurrence there isn't any visible cancer in my body My treatment team was on the fence and they all disagreed about chemo and radiation The medical oncologist thought chemo might not be necessary but I was scared at the time and she was more than happy to proceed with 6 cycles The tumor board thinks chemo and radiation are both necessary My gynecological oncologist doesn't think I should do pelvic radiation because of severe side effects the radiation oncologist obviously thinks it's no big deal (and radiation is probably MORE helpful at preventing recurrence than chemo) So I start chemo cycle 6 tomorrow and I am MISERABLE My eyes water 24 7 my legs are swollen and I am retaining fluid constant diarrhea my legs hurt and feel like lead and I get winded just standing up from the,1,1,2,1,1,2,0,0,0,1
